                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The idea of TutorConnect was inspired by our adviser, who gave us a hint that sparked our imagination. We took that initial idea and expanded it, driven by our collective desire to make quality education accessible to everyone. As students, we understand the challenges of finding reliable and effective tutoring, and we set out to create a solution that addresses these needs.</p>

Our platform is not only focused on academic subjects but is also open to areas like dancing, singing, and more. As long as the tutor and learner can meet, TutorConnect is here to facilitate the connection. With features and an intuitive interface, TutorConnect makes the process of finding a tutor nearby simple.</p>
